## Introduction

The Fox and the Geese is a 2-player game in which one player controls the "Fox" and the other controls the "Geese."

To win, the Fox has to hunt 12 of the Geese. On the other hand, the Geese win if they manage to trap the Fox so that he can no longer move.

This project was developed together with 4 colleagues from the university, its base statement is found in the "Statement" folder.

In addition, the code has a self-contained report, in which each function, declaration of particular variables and points of attention has comments that clarify the total functioning of each part of the program.
